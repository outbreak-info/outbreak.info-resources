The\nmolecular biology of a virus infection pathogenesis determines the genetic\ntarget and the human phenotype-determining enzymes decide about the difference between infection and disease. In the case that <i>O</i>-glycosylation\nplays a key role in the pathogenesis of coronavirus infections, as was discussed\nalready 14 years ago in a SARS-CoV virus infection and is currently again predicted for SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, this would involve the formation of hybrid, serologically\nA-like, <i>O</i>-GalNAc\u03b11-Ser/Thr-R, Tn (\u201cT\nnouvelle\u201d) antigenic structures. Although the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2) protein\nis defined as the primary SARS-CoV receptor, it is the history of the amino acid serine, suggesting the actual or additional binding via an intermediate hybrid <i>O</i>-glycan: the TMPRSS2 (transmembrane\nprotease serine subtype 2) host protease-mobilized, virus-encoded serine molecule gets access to the host's N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) metabolism and the resulting intermediate, hybrid A-like/Tn structure performs the\nadhesion of the virus to host cells primarily independent of the ABO blood\ngroup, while the phenotype-determining sugars become the final glycosidic target. Individuals with blood\ngroup A and B cannot respond with preformed innate antibodies to the synthesis of A-like/Tn structures due to phenotypic accommodation of plasma\nproteins but perform a further (blood group-A- and/or B-specific) hybrid binding, most\nlikely causing autoimmune reactions.

All countries in the world are racing against time to fight the spread and deadly effects of this virus. This paper is a short meta analysis (short/rapid communications) literature review of COVID-19 / NCOV / Corona Virus in the Scopus, Dimensions, Lens, and Europe PMC database. We aim to find out the profile of publications about Corona Virus in the world, and do a short assessment using the principles of open access in knowledge distribution. The method used is literature review using commercial and non-commercial databases which are then visualized using simple spreadsheets software. The results of this study indicate that non-commercial databases also need to be used by researchers because they contain a much larger number of documents than major commercial databases. The majority of publications are peer reviewed articles in prestige journals (indicated by a high JIF). Gold OA and hybrid journals are generally chosen although the cost of publication (APC) is very expensive (up to USD 5000). The next option would be a non-OA association journal (eg: JAMA). The research itself was carried out by a small number of countries: Asia (China, Japan, India), the US, Europe (UK and Germany), and Saudi Arabia. When linked to the urgency of a pandemic disaster, COVID-19 research, especially those carried out in under-represented countries, needs to maximize the publicity via public repositories (Green OA route) under supervision of research communities to jointly review and test the validity. Publication via journal can be done as a later step.</p>Keywords: COVID-19, pandemic, open access, prestige journal, knowledge distribution", "keywords": ["COVID19", "Corona Virus", "Openscience", "Science Policy", "Self archiving", "bibliometric analysis", "corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19", "knowledge distribution", "pengarsipan mandiri", "sains terbuka", "sains terbuka indonesia"], "name": "The rapid publications on COVID:  An open science perspective"}, {"_id": "figshare12094116", "_score": 0.87340903, "description": "Codon, codon pair and dinucleotide usage frequences for SARS-CoV-2 compared to other coronaviruses and host species and tissues.

In this study, the RNA-binding N terminal domain (NTD) of the N protein was targeted for the identification of possible inhibitors of RNA binding. Two NTD structures of N proteins were selected (2OFZ and 1SSK, 92% homology) for virtual screening of 56,079 compounds from Asinex and Maybridge library to identify top 15 hits for each of the targets based on \u2018docking score\u2019. These top-hits were further screened for MM-GBSA binding free energy, pharmacokinetic properties (QikProp) and drug-likeness (SwissADME) and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) studies. Two suitable binders (ZINC00003118440 and ZINC0000146942) against the target 2OFZ were identified. ZINC00003118440 is a theophylline derivative under the drug class \u2018bronchodilators\u2019 and further screening with approved bronchodilators was also studied to identify their ability to bind to the RNA binding region on the N protein.

Rational use requires: (1) modification of the clozapine package insert worldwide to include lower doses for Asians and to avoid the lethality associated with pneumonia, (2) the use of clozapine levels for personalizing dosing, and (3) the use of slow and personalized titration. This may make clozapine as safe as possible and contribute to increased life expectancy and well-being. In the absence of data on COVID-19 in clozapine patients, clozapine possibly impairs immunological mechanisms and may increase pneumonia risk in infected patients.

Moreover, the detection of highly divergent or yet unknown viruses is a major challenge despite of its clinical importance. In this situation, the outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its susceptibility in different epidemic condition around the world clearly suggest that the virus is mutating to create divergent variants and making the task of virus prediction more challenging. On the other hand, despite of novel coronavirus, two more coronaviruses such as MERS and SARS-CoV-1 are already present. Therefore, the use of machine learning technique is highly required at this moment to predict the coronaviruses by considering their divergent genetic functional characteristics. Thus, we are proposing machine learning based coronavirus prediction technique, called COVID-Predictor, where 1000 of RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-1, MERS, SARS-CoV-2 and other virus are used to train a Na\u00efve Bayes classifier so that it can predict any unknown sequence of these viruses. In order to develop the COVID-Predictor, the feature vector is constructed by the motifs of the sequence generated by k-mer and n-gram techniques. The model has been validated using 10 fold cross validation in comparison with other classification techniques. The results show the superiority of our predictor by achieving average 97\\% accuracy on unseen validation set. The same pre-trained model has been used to design a web based application where RNA sequences of unknown viruses can be uploaded to predict class of coronavirus.The predictor, code and datasets are available here: http://www.nitttrkol.ac.in/indrajit/projects/COVID-Predictor/", "keywords": ["Bioinformatics", "Bioinformatics Software", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus", "Health Informatics", "MERS", "Machine Learning", "Pattern Recognition and Data Mining", "RNA Sequence", "SARS", "SARS-CoV-2", "k-mer"], "name": "COVID-Predictor: RNA Sequence based Prediction of Coronavirus"}, {"_id": "figshare12142521", "_score": 0.87340903, "description": "Documentos o gu\u00edas que brindan recomendaciones para el cuidado de la salud materna.", "keywords": ["COVID-19", "Epidemiology", "Maternal health", "Obstetrics and Gynaecology"], "name": "COVID-19: Salud Materna"}, {"_id": "figshare12143112", "_score": 0.87340903, "description": "<p>Data and code for social contact analysis in China.</p>", "keywords": ["Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified", "Biotechnology", "COVID-19", "Chemical Sciences not elsewhere classified", "Information Systems not elsewhere classified", "Inorganic Chemistry", "Sociology", "social contact"], "name": "Data and code for changes in contact patterns shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China"}, {"_id": "figshare12143139", "_score": 0.87340903, "description": "<p>Datasets in this publication report the number of diagnoses with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as reported by the Department of Health in Ireland.

Worldwide this disease has infected over 2.5 million individuals with a mortality rate ranging from 5 to 10%. There are several efforts going on in the drug discovery to control the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. The main protease (M<sup>Pro</sup>) plays a critical role in viral replication and maturation, thus can serve as the primary drug target. To understand the structural evolution of M<sup>Pro</sup>, we have performed phylogenetic and Sequence Similarity Network analysis, that depicted divergence of Coronaviridae M<sup>Pro</sup> in five clusters specific to viral hosts. This clustering was corroborated with the comparison of M<sup>Pro</sup> structures. Furthermore, it has been observed that backbone and binding site conformations are conserved despite variation in some of the residues. These attributes can be exploited to repurpose available viral protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>Pro</sup>. In agreement with this, we performed screening of \u223c7100 molecules including active ingredients present in the Ayurvedic anti-tussive medicines, anti-viral phytochemicals and synthetic anti-virals against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>Pro</sup> as the primary target. We identified several natural molecules like \u03b4-viniferin, myricitrin, taiwanhomoflavone A, lactucopicrin 15-oxalate, nympholide A, afzelin, biorobin, hesperidin and phyllaemblicin B that strongly binds to SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>Pro</sup>. Intrestingly, these molecules also showed strong binding with other potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection like viral receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We anticipate that our approach for identification of multi-target-directed ligand will provide new avenues for drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p> <p>Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Nowadays, the world encounters a huge health crisis by the COVID-19 viral infection. Nucleotide inhibitors gave a lot of promising results in terms of its efficacy against different viral infections. In this work, molecular modeling, docking, and dynamics simulations are used to build a model for the viral protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and test its binding affinity to some clinically approved drugs and drug candidates. Molecular dynamics is used to equilibrate the system upon binding calculations to ensure the successful reproduction of previous results, to include the dynamics of the RdRp, and to understand how it affects the binding. The results show the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Cefuroxime, Tenofovir, and Hydroxychloroquine, in binding to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, Setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184, show better results, while four novel IDX-184 derivatives show promising results in attaching to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. There is an urgent need to specify drugs that can selectively bind and subsequently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The availability of a punch of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs can help us in this mission, aiming to reduce the danger of COVID-19.

In this brief report, the official data provided by the Italian Ministry of Health were analyzed using fitting models and the linear fit method approach. This last methodology allowed us to reach two findings. The trend of the number of deaths followed a 1\u20133-day delay of positive cases. This delay was not compatible with a biological course of Covid-19 but was compatible with a health management explanation. The second finding is that the Italian number of deaths did not increase linearly with the number of positive cases, but their relationship could be modeled by a second-order polynomial function.

An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy.

This is a question that billions of people are wondering early 2020 due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This virus can produce a severe pneumonia that has killed over 230,000 people so far, was detected for the first time late 2019 in Wuhan (China), and has spread all over the world due, in part, to the difficulty of detecting and isolating asymptomatic or mild-symptomatic cases. In this paper, we explore how long suppression strategies (i.e., home confinement and social distancing) must be put into practice in highly populated cities to reduce the chances that a quick rebound of COVID-19 infections occur again over the next months. This is explored, using New York City (USA), San Francisco (USA), and Madrid (Spain) as case studies, through a simple but realistic Monte Carlo stochastic model that takes into account that part of the undetected infected individuals remain in circulation propagating the virus. Our simulations reflect that, if suppression strategies are not properly applied, they can be counterproductive because there are high chances that the confinement time has to be lengthened without reducing the total number of infections. We also estimate that, in the most conservative scenario and under the model assumptions, home confinement is effective if applied at least ~110 days in New York City, ~80 days in San Francisco, and ~70 days in Madrid, i.e., until mid-July 2020, early June 2020, and late May 2020, respectively.</p>", "keywords": ["Applied Physics", "Astrophysics", "Biophysics", "COVID-19", "Classical Physics not elsewhere classified", "Classical and Physical Optics", "Cloud Physics", "Computational Physics", "Condensed Matter Physics", "Condensed Matter Physics not elsewhere classified", "High Energy Astrophysics; Cosmic Rays", "Mathematical Physics not elsewhere classified", "Mesospheric, Ionospheric and Magnetospheric Physics", "Particle Physics", "Photonics, Optoelectronics and Optical Communications", "Physical Chemistry not elsewhere classified", "Physical Chemistry of Materials", "Plasma Physics", "Quantum Physics not elsewhere classified", "Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets", "Space and Solar Physics", "Tropospheric and Stratospheric Physics", "confinement time", "coronavirus", "quick rebound", "stochastic model"], "name": "Data_Sheet_1_Confinement Time Required to Avoid a Quick Rebound of COVID-19: Predictions From a Monte Carlo Stochastic Model.PDF"}, {"_id": "figshare12272015", "_score": 0.87340903, "description": "<div>Molecular dynamics simulation trajectory.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected, as of April 22, 2020, 2,623,231 people globally, causing a major public health problem worldwide. Currently, no vaccine or treatment is available to control this pandemic. We analyzed the number of positive cases and deaths in different countries and correlated them with the inclusion of BCG vaccination at birth in their national vaccination programs. Interestingly, those countries where BCG vaccination is given at birth have shown a lower contagion rate and fewer COVID-19-related deaths, suggesting that this vaccine may induce trained immunity that could confer some protection for SARS-CoV-2.</p>", "keywords": ["Animal Immunology", "Applied Immunology (incl.

In this original research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm.</p><p>Materials and Methods: Development of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip resulted in a ready-to-use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analyzed for the cross-reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi-centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip results were compared with qRT-PCR as golden standard for COVID-19 diagnostics.</p><p>Results: In the analytical performance study, the reproducibility showed a between-observer disagreement of 1.7%, a robustness of 98%, an overall satisfying user friendliness and no cross-reactivity with other virus-infected nasopharyngeal samples. In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories during the ascendant phase of the epidemiological curve, we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6 and 99.5%, respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut-off of the ICT was found at CT <22. User-friendliness analysis and risk management assessment through Ishikawa diagram demonstrate that COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip may be implemented in clinical laboratories according to biosafety recommendations.</p><p>Conclusion: The COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip represents a promising rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 in 15 min at the peak of the pandemic. Its role in the proposed diagnostic algorithm is complementary to the currently-used molecular techniques.</p>", "keywords": ["COVID-19", "Dermatology", "Emergency Medicine", "Family Care", "Foetal Development and Medicine", "Gastroenterology and Hepatology", "Geriatrics and Gerontology", "Intensive Care", "Medical Genetics (excl.

For example, by removing air pollutants trees contribute to fewer health impacts, and tree cover expansion could extend these benefits by targeting the most polluted areas and vulnerable populations. To support strategic tree expansion, this research created urban tree cover maps using the 2017 NASA MOD44B satellite 250 m pixel product for 35 megacities, areas with large levels of pollution and vulnerable populations. Estimates of tree cover from photo-interpretation (PI) were used to characterize map error, city-wide, and from low to high tree cover, using 21 bins from 0 to 100% tree cover. Map accuracy was highest when MOD44B percent tree cover was combined with its tree cover standard deviation product, with average difference of 1.8% compared with PI estimates of 19.9% city-wide tree cover. MOD44B estimates of tree cover spatial patterns had strong explanatory value. The maps explained the PI estimates of low to high tree cover at 5% tree cover intervals with an R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97. The Getis Ord Gi<sup>*</sup> statistic determined a non-random spatial distribution of tree cover within the megacities, with significant clustering into hot spots of relatively high tree cover and cold spots of relatively low tree cover. Tree cover hot spots were most often furthest from downtown, at the rural-urban interface or within higher elevation terrain. Tree cover cold spots were most often in areas of concentrated development and along traffic corridors known for high levels of particulate matter and other air pollutants that could be reduced by trees. Given small increases in exposure to particulate matter are associated with significant increases in death rates from viruses, and that climate change and associated heat waves are forecast to exacerbate health risks to air pollution, we need to improve global urban tree cover. These map products can be used to expand tree cover that strategically contributes to pollutant abatement, human well-being, and sustainable cities.</p>", "keywords": ["Architectural Science and Technology (incl.

Meanwhile, the presence of B<sup>0</sup>AT1 (SLC6A19) may prevent TMPRSS2 from accessing the cutting position on ACE2. Identifying the expression of these cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in various tissues, especially in the kidney. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The single-cell transcription datasets of the human cell landscape (HCL) and other relevant single-cell transcription databases were used to analyze the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and SLC6A19 in various organs and tissues, but mainly in the kidney. <b><i>Results:</i></b> ACE2 was significantly expressed in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of proximal tubule (PT) cells. TMPRSS2 was widely expressed in several renal tubule populations extending from the PT cells to the collection system cell type, of which intercalated cells and the distal convoluted tubule cells showed more significant expression than PT cells. Unexpectedly, although expressed on various renal tubule populations, SLC6A19 was mainly enriched in PT cells, in line with ACE2 expression. Although alveolar-type (AT) 2 cells of the lung and intestinal epithelial cells expressed ACE2 as well as PT cells, AT 2 cells significantly expressed TMPRSS2 but not SLC6A19, while all 3 genes were significantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> ACE2 was widely expressed in specific cell subgroups of various human tissues, especially in intestinal epithelial cells, kidney PT cells, and also AT 2 cells of the lung.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has attracted the attention of the whole world. Our study aimed to describe illness progression and risk profiles for mortality in non-survivors.</p><p>Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 155 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and focused on 18 non-survivors among them. Briefly, we compared the dynamic profile of biochemical and immune parameters and drew an epidemiological and clinical picture of disease progression from disease onset to death in non-survivors. The survival status of the cohort was indicated by a Kaplan\u2013Meier curve.</p><p>Results. Of the non-survivors, the median age was 73.5 years, and the proportion of males was 72.2%. Five and 13 patients were hospital-acquired and community-acquired infection of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The interval between disease onset and diagnosis was 8.5 days (IQR, [4\u201311]). With the deterioration of disease, most patients experienced consecutive changes in biochemical parameters, including lymphopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinemia, as well as elevated D-dimer and procalcitonin. Regarding the immune dysregulation, patients exhibited significantly decreased T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, including CD3<sup>+</sup>T, CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>Th, and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>Tc cells. By the end of the disease, most patients suffered from severe complications, including ARDS (17/18; 94.4%), acute cardiac injury (10/18; 55.6%), acute kidney injury (7/18; 38.9%), shock (6/18; 33.3%), gastrointestinal bleeding (1/18; 5.6%), as well as perforation of intestine (1/18; 5.6%).

Currently there are no approved drugs for the treatment of coronaviral disease (COVID-19), although some of the drugs have been tried. Chloroquine is being widely used in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine, the derivative of Chloroquine shows better inhibition than Chloroquine and has in\u00a0vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 also used to treat COVID-19. To study the interactions of Chloroquine and derivatives of Chloroquine with SARS-CoV-2, series of computational approaches like pharmacophore model, molecular docking, MM_GBSA study and ADME property analysis are explored. The pharmacophore model and molecular docking study are used to explore the structural properties of the compounds and the ligand-receptor (<b>PDB_ID: 6LU7</b>) interactions respectively. MM_GBSA study gives the binding free energy of the protein-ligand complex and ADME property analysis explains the pharmacological property of the compounds.

This novel coronavirus, responsible by the COVID-19 outbreak since the end of 2019, became a challenge since there is not vaccine for this disease. The first step in this investigation was to solvate the isolated S-protein in water for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, being observed a transition from \u201cup\u201d to \u201cdown\u201d conformation of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein with angle of 54.3 and 43.0 degrees, respectively. The RBD region was more exposed to the solvent and to the possible drugs due to its enhanced surface area. From the equilibrated MD structure, virtual screening by docking calculations were performed using a library contained 9091 FDA approved drugs. Among them, 24 best-scored ligands (14 traditional herbal isolate and 10 approved drugs) with the binding energy below \u20138.1\u2009kcal/mol were selected as potential candidates to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2\u2009S-protein, preventing the human cell infection and their replication.

For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift toward death was lower in the CHM plus group than in the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148\u20132.352, P = 0.454). Three (two from the CHM plus group and one from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 17.86% (5/28) vs. 14.29% (2/28), 71.43% (20/28) vs. 64.29% (9/28), and 0% (0) vs. 7.14% (1/28) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone.</p><p>Conclusions: For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The effects of CHM in COVID-19 may be clinically important and warrant further consideration and studies.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx.

Several factors may be involved in the association between COVID-19 and psychiatric outcomes, such as fear inherent in the pandemic, adverse effects of treatments, as well as financial stress, and social isolation. Herein we discuss the growing evidence suggesting that the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and host may also trigger changes in brain and behavior. Based on the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it is conceivable that changes in endocrine and immune response in the periphery or in the central nervous system may be involved in the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and impaired mental health. This is likely to be further enhanced, since millions of people worldwide are isolated in quarantine to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and social isolation can also lead to neuroendocrine-immune changes.

Using a mechanistic-statistical formalism, we estimate the effect of the lockdown in France on the contact rate and the effective reproduction number R<sub>e</sub> of the COVID-19. We obtain a reduction by a factor 7 (R<sub>e</sub> = 0.47, 95%-CI: 0.45\u20130.50), compared to the estimates carried out in France at the early stage of the epidemic. We also estimate the fraction of the population that would be infected by the beginning of May, at the official date at which the lockdown should be relaxed. We find a fraction of 3.7% (95%-CI: 3.0\u20134.8%) of the total French population, without taking into account the number of recovered individuals before April 1st, which is not known. This proportion is seemingly too low to reach herd immunity. Thus, even if the lockdown strongly mitigated the first epidemic wave, keeping a low value of R<sub>e</sub> is crucial to avoid an uncontrolled second wave (initiated with much more infectious cases than the first wave) and to hence avoid the saturation of hospital facilities.</p>", "keywords": ["Bayesian inference", "COVID-19", "Dermatology", "Emergency Medicine", "Family Care", "Foetal Development and Medicine", "Gastroenterology and Hepatology", "Geriatrics and Gerontology", "Intensive Care", "Medical Genetics (excl.

This review describes the main clinical features of COVID-19 and potential role of microbiota in COVID-19. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 79.5% nucleotide sequence identity and use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter host cells. The distribution of ACE2 may determine how SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory and digestive tract. SARS and COVID-19 share similar clinical features, although the estimated fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower. The communication between the microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 and the role of this association in diagnosis and treatment are unclear. Changes in the lung microbiota were identified in COVID-19 patients, and the enrichment of the lung microbiota with bacteria found in the intestinal tract is correlated with the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome and long-term outcomes. ACE2 regulates the gut microbiota by indirectly controlling the secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Moreover, the gut microbiota enhances antiviral immunity by increasing the number and function of immune cells, decreasing immunopathology, and stimulating interferon production. In turn, respiratory viruses are known to influence microbial composition in the lung and intestine. Therefore, the analysis of changes in the microbiota during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help predict patient outcomes and allow the development of microbiota-based therapies.</p>", "keywords": ["ACE2", "COVID-19", "Microbial Ecology", "Microbial Genetics", "Microbiology", "Mycology", "SARS-CoV-2", "SCFAs", "microbiota"], "name": "Table_1_Main Clinical Features of COVID-19 and Potential Prognostic and Therapeutic Value of the Microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 Infections.docx"}, {"_id": "figshare12442031", "_score": 0.87340903, "description": "Data set", "keywords": ["COVID-19", "Clinical Microbiology", "Medical Infection Agents (incl.

The results demonstrated that severe patients tend to present with increased white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reaction protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and a decreased number of total lymphocyte and lymphocyte subtypes, such as CD4+ T lymphocyte and CD8+ T lymphocyte, compared to the non-severe patients. In addition, the WBC count>10 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup>/L, lymphocyte count<1 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup>/L, PCT>0.5 ng/mL, and CRP>10 mg/L were risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (WBC count>10 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup>/L: OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.96\u20134.35; lymphocyte count<1 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup>/L: OR = 4.97, 95% CI: 3.53\u20136.99; PCT>0.5 ng/mL: OR = 6.33, 95% CI: 3.97\u201310.10; CRP>10 mg/L: OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 2.38\u20135.16). Furthermore, we found that NLR, as a novel marker of systemic inflammatory response, can also help predict clinical severity in patients with COVID-19 (OR = 2.50, 95% CI: 2.04\u20133.06).</p><p>Conclusions: Immune-inflammatory parameters, such as WBC, lymphocyte, PCT, CRP, and NLR, could imply the progression of COVID-19. NLR has taken both the levels of neutrophil and lymphocyte into account, indicating a more complete, accurate, and reliable inspection efficiency; surveillance of NLR may help clinicians identify high-risk COVID-19 patients at an early stage.</p>", "keywords": ["COVID-19", "Dermatology", "Emergency Medicine", "Family Care", "Foetal Development and Medicine", "Gastroenterology and Hepatology", "Geriatrics and Gerontology", "Intensive Care", "Medical Genetics (excl.

Complex was placed in the cubic boxes with explicit TIP3P water models that have 10.0 &Aring; thickness from surfaces of protein. The system is&nbsp;neutralized by adding counter ions, and salt solution of 0.15M NaCl was also used to adjust the concentration of the systems. The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated by the particle mesh Ewald method. A cutoff<br>\nradius of 9.0 &Aring; was used for both van der Waals and Coulombic interactions.

Little is known about risk factors for progression to severe disease in Europe. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 patients in a Swiss university hospital.</p>\n\n<p>Methods<br>\nThis retrospective observational study included all adult patients hospitalized with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to March 25, 2020. We extracted data from electronic health records. The primary outcome was the need to mechanical ventilation at day 14.&nbsp; We used multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for mechanical ventilation.

Multivariable regression showed increased odds of mechanical ventilation in males (3.26, 1.21-9.8; p=0.025), in patients who presented with a qSOFA score &ge;2 (6.02, 2.09-18.82; p=0.001), with bilateral infiltrate (5.75, 1.91-21.06; p=0.004) or with a CRP of 40 mg/l or greater (4.73, 1.51-18.58; p=0.013).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nConclusions<br>\nThis study gives some insight in the epidemiology and clinical course of patients admitted in a European tertiary hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Energy minimization used CPU pmemd, while later simulation stages used GPU pmemd. CoV2 and CoV1 systems with one RBD up (with/without ACE2) were solvated in 12 angstrom water shells. Cysteine residues identified in the initial models as having a disulfide bond (DB) were bonded using tLeap. All simulations used 0.150 M NaCl. Hydrogen mass repartitioning was applied only to the protein to enable a 4 fs timestep (<a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpubs.acs.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1021%2Fct5010406\">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct5010406</a>). The SHAKE algorithm was applied to hydrogens, and a real-space cutoff of 8 angstroms was used. Periodic boundary conditions were applied and PME was used for long-range electrostatics. Minimization was by steepest descent (2000 steps) followed by conjugate gradient (3000 steps). Heating used two stages: (1) NVT heating from 0 K to 100 K (50 ps), and (2) NPT heating from 100 K to 300 K (100 ps). Restraints of 10 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;angstrom<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;were applied during minimization and heating to C-alpha atoms. During 6 ns of equilibration at 300 K C-alpha restraints were gradually reduced from 10 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;angstrom<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;to 0.1 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;angstrom<sup>-2</sup>. Finally, restraints were released and 320 ns unrestrained production simulations were carried out for CoV2 and CoV1 systems. Production simulations began from the final equilibrated snapshots, and five copies of each system were simulated. As unrestrained systems can freely rotate we monitored simulations for any close contacts and found that in one copy of the CoV1 simulation without ACE2 and one RBD up that a few contacts close to 8 angstrom occur near the end of the 320 ns between the RBD and a different subdomain of the spike complex in a periodic image. However this did not influence analyzed structural properties which is verified by comparing results across simulations. The Monte Carlo barostat was used to maintain pressure (1 atm), and the Langevin thermostat was used to maintain 300 K temperature (collision frequency 1 ps<sup>-1</sup>), as implemented in Amber18.

This is based on the PageRank<sup>3</sup> network analysis method. In the context of citation networks, it estimates the importance of each article based on its centrality in the whole network. This measure was calculated using the PaperRanking (<a href=\"https://github.com/diwis/PaperRanking\">https://github.com/diwis/PaperRanking</a>) library<sup>4</sup>.</li>\n\t<li><em><strong>Popularity:</strong></em> Citation-based measure reflecting the current impact of an article. This is based on the RAM<sup>5</sup> citation network analysis method. Methods like PageRank are biased against recently published articles (new articles need time to receive their first citations). RAM alleviates this problem using an approach known as &quot;time-awareness&quot;. This is why it is more suitable to capture the current &quot;hype&quot; of an article. This measure was calculated using the PaperRanking (<a href=\"https://github.com/diwis/PaperRanking\">https://github.com/diwis/PaperRanking</a>) library<sup>4</sup>.</li>\n\t<li><em><strong>Social Media Attention: </strong></em>The number of tweets related to this article. Relevant data were collected from the <a href=\"https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs\">COVID-19-TweetIDs</a> dataset. In this version, only tweets between Jan. 21<sup>st</sup> and Mar. 31<sup>st</sup> have been considered from the previous dataset. The rest will be included during next updates.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We provide three CSV files, all containing the same information, however each having its entries ordered by a different impact measure.

As of April 29, 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 200,000 lives, with a global mortality rate of ~7% and recovery rate of ~30%. Understanding the interaction of cellular targets to the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of COVID-19 compared to different respiratory viruses (Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine unique anti-COVID1-19 gene signature. We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The <em>NRCAM</em>&nbsp;and <em>SAA2</em>&nbsp;that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and <em>FGF1</em>&nbsp;and <em>FOXO1</em>genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the <em>IL-8</em>, <em>IL-6</em>, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was <em>SERPINB1</em>. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of both COVID-19 and Ebola are more similar compared to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Supplementary tables and figures</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>&nbsp;: Significant DEGs across the five&nbsp;transcriptomic&nbsp;profiles , corresponding genes, chromosome locations, gene expression &nbsp;and significance scores.

The presence of combined critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM) was defined by very low amplitude of CMAP and/or SNAP on neurophysiological evaluation with normal or mildly reduced nerve conduction velocities, combined with myopathic features on needle electromyography.&nbsp;Data about pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension were also collected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>\n\n<p>Between March 23 March 2020 to 10 April 2020, we performed ENG studies in 9 patients.

In this prospective observational study we evaluated the ability of long PP sessions to improve oxygenation in awake ICU patients with moderate or severe ARDS due to COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Methods</strong>:<br>\nThe study was approved by the ethics committee of Galicia (code No. 2020-188), and all patients provided informed consent. In this case series, awake patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID-19 admitted to the ICU at University Hospital of Santiago from March 21 to April 5, 2020 were prospectively analyzed. Patients were instructed to remain in PP as long as possible and not stop until the they felt too tired to maintain that position. If needed, light sedation was administered. The following information were collected: StO2 and blood gases (PaO2, PaO2/FiO2, PaCO2, pH) in ICU admission, number and duration of PP sessions, StO2 and blood gases before, during and following a PP session, need of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU admission and ICU outcome. Linear mixed effects models (LMM) were adjusted to estimate changes of oxygenation parameters from baseline,. Patients were added as a random effect to account for inter-patient random variability in their own baseline measurements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Results</strong>:<br>\nSeven patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID-19 were included. All patients received at least one PP session. A total of 16 PP sessions were performed in the 7 patients during the period study. The median duration of PP sessions was 10 hours. For PP sessions of more than 4 hours, dexmedetomidine was used for sedation. Oxygenation increased in all sixteen sessions performed in the seven patients. Prone positioning was associated to a net increase from baseline in PaO2, PaO2/FiO2 and StO2 (65, mmHg 110 and 2.6% respectively) PaO2/FiO2 increased during PP (&Delta; PaO2/FiO2 110.42 mmHg [28.173; 192.67]) and after PP (37.75 [-1.57; 77.07] compared with previous supine position (baseline PaO2FiO2 median-IQR97.8 [97.2 &ndash; 99.4]). Two patients required intubation. Six patients were discharged from the ICU and one remains on mechanical ventilation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>:<br>\nWe found that PP improved oxygenation and may avoid intubation in ICU patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS. PP was relatively well tolerated in our patients. and may be a simple strategy to improve oxygenation trying to reduce patients in mechanical ventilation and the length of stay in the ICU, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GitHub repository</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>https://github.com/medicalc/prone_sars</p>", "keywords": ["Anesthesia", "COVID-19", "Critical Care", "SARS",
